# bubblesort
Explanation:
This code implements a program to sort a list of numbers in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm. Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.

The bubble_sort function takes a parameter numbers, which is the list of numbers to be sorted, and performs the following steps:

It determines the length of the numbers list and assigns it to the variable n.
It uses two nested for loops to iterate through the list.
The outer loop runs n - 1 times because after each pass, the largest element is guaranteed to be in its correct position, so we don't need to compare it again.
The inner loop runs n - 1 - i times because after each pass, the largest i elements are already sorted and placed at the end of the list.
For each pair of adjacent elements, if the current element is greater than the next element, they are swapped using tuple unpacking (numbers[j], numbers[j + 1] = numbers[j + 1], numbers[j]).
This swapping process continues until the list is fully sorted.
The function modifies the numbers list in place.
In the main part of the code, the user is prompted to enter a list of numbers separated by spaces. The input is stored in the input_list variable. The input string is then split into individual numbers using the split() method, and each number is converted to an integer using a list comprehension to form the numbers list.
The bubble_sort function is called with the numbers list as an argument to sort the list in ascending order.
Finally, the program prints the sorted numbers in ascending order.

Please note that Bubble Sort is not the most efficient sorting algorithm for large lists. Other more efficient sorting algorithms, such as QuickSort or MergeSort, are commonly used in practice.
